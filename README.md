### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I like to create fun things like OpenGL games, Emulators, Programming Languages, and whatever catches my interest.
- I'm also a Computer Engineering undergrad student at UFPE.

It's always better when you can show what you're working on to your friends and family so here are some pics.

-Myncraft
  -[Myncraft](https://github.com/gbrls/myncraft/) is a 3D voxel based game inspired by it's homophone.
-Jacquin's Hell
  -[Jacquin's Hell](https://github.com/gbrls/if669-jogo) is a raycasting game that I made with some friends as an assignment.
-CHIP-8 Mk2
  -[CHIP-8 Mk2](https://github.com/gbrls/chip-8-mk2) is a CHIP-8 emulator with a debugger interface.
-MyLisp
  -[MyLisp](https://github.com/gbrls/myLisp) is a lisp-like programming language, it's not good, but it was really fun to implement. 
It learnt a lot of things in the process, I even wrote a little bit about it.
