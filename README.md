### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=gbrls.gbrls)


- I like to create fun things like OpenGL games, Emulators, Programming Languages, and whatever catches my interest.
- Computer Engineering undergrad student at UFPE.

Those are some of by best projets:

- [**Myncraft**](https://github.com/gbrls/myncraft/) is a 3D voxel based game inspired by it's homophone.
- [**Jacquin's Hell**](https://github.com/gbrls/if669-jogo) is a raycasting game that I made with some friends as an assignment.
- [**CHIP-8 Mk2**](https://github.com/gbrls/chip-8-mk2) is a CHIP-8 emulator with a debugger interface.
- [**MyLisp**](https://github.com/gbrls/myLisp) is a lisp-like programming language, it's not good, but it was really fun to implement. I learnt a lot of things in the process, I even wrote a little bit about it.
- [**Malish Lisp**](https://github.com/gbrls/rust-lisp-malish) is my second attempt on writing an interpreter for a Lisp-like language. It's much better than it's predecessor and it's loosely based on [MAL](https://github.com/kanaka/mal).
- [**Microc**](https://github.com/gbrls/rust-microc) is a compiler for MicroC (a subset of C) that targets the x86_64 architecture.
